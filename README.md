### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 
My name is Arthur Strekozov. I live in Saint-Petersburg and I am currently completing a master's Peter the Great St.Petersburg Polytechnic University (SPbPU). 
I love information technology and everything connected with it! At the moment, I am interested in data analytics and machine learning. 
Sometimes I study new techniques in computer vision and information security. I look with interest towards the development of prostheses / augmentations.


Skills: Ð¡/C++ / Python
